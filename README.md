# TrailFinder

[Trail-finder.org](https://www.trail-finder.org) is a website that allows users to search for hiking trails around the country.  Users can create accounts and add trails to "Completed" and "Favorites" lists and receive driving directions via Google Maps.

Built on a Node/Express/React/MongoDB stack and hosted on Google Cloud, it also uses Passport for authentication, several Google Maps APIs, and the Hiking Project publicly available API.

NOTE: Currently not deployed.
